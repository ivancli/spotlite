TODO
----------------------------------

IMPORTANT:

1. show welcome message when user first login (right after register)

    1) move the current welcome/success message to a popup

    2) modify the welcome/success message just so it depends on the subscription package


2. prompt user if they haven't set up a group

    1) might need to use notification js plugins
        a). http://ned.im/noty/
        b). https://notifyjs.com/

    2) modify group CRUD
        a). ignore group with the same name instead of prompting errors
        b). attach user to the group soon as it's created. (should work without making changes)

3. Update profile management to use Ajax

4. Dependency injection in queue job classes

5. Push logging to queue instead of logging immediately

6. Update cancel subscription to use ajax.
