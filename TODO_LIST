IMPORTANT:
quick add subscription status check when user login.

1. show welcome message when user first login (right after register)
    1) move the current welcome/success message to a popup
    2) modify the welcome/success message just so it depends on the subscription package
2. prompt user if they haven't set up a group
    1) might need to use notification js plugins
        a). http://ned.im/noty/
        b). https://notifyjs.com/
    2) modify group CRUD
        a). ignore group with the same name instead of prompting errors
        b). attach user to the group soon as it's created. (should work without making changes)
3. check the websites provided by Ryan
    http://www.pricetrakker.com/
    https://www.import.io/
    http://www.price2spy.com/
    1) check the necessity of verify email addresses on registration.
    2) check the way their registration and payment process work
4. work on subscription management page
    1) view current subscription information
    2) upgrade or downgrade my subscription package
5. work on profile management page
6. hide admin sidebar items from client users
